**How has New York driving behaviour changed from the past to post-Covid?** 
What is an accurate average distance per journey (origin to destination) when driving from/to or through New York City? This should be a more accurate picture of road usage in the city of all vehicles on the road, rather than just road usage of New York residents. How can this inform the decisions we make to tackle congestion and the adoption of alternative modes of transport? What will be the predicted peak hours for demand in the post-COVID travel environment? Will it be a flatten and lengthening of the curve or will we see spikes at different times? Is the rise of active travel and micro-mobility having an impact on car usage?
