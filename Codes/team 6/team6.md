**What are the best ways to improve air quality in London through transport changes?**  
What are realistic and practical solutions to tackle the problem? Consider alternative policies, e.g. is it better to take X number of any cars off road, better to add X number of only electric vehicles, or hybrid cars going forward or better to take X number of the worst polluting cars off the road? How about the influences from exhaust and non-exhaust (tyres, brakes etc.) pollutants? What is the ratio and impact on air quality between quantity of cars versus idling vehicles? Consider comparison with other cities such as New York.
