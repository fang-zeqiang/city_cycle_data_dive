**Will future commuter travel in London be more or less active?**
Has there been a shift (proportionally and to what scale / impact) to more or less active travel (cycling and walking) for London commuters in recent years? Do the changes in commuter travel seen during 2020 indicate such trends might change in future? What might be the cause, e.g. infrastructure changes, of shifts onto or away from active travel for residents of different areas of London? Is there a shift of usage between rail travel and active modes? What impact does weather have on shift to resilient active travel modes and micro-mobility? Can we determine between long term adoption and short term use of active travel and what are the variations between and in these groups?
