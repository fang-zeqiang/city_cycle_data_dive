# Data-Dive-2021

This is the repository for **CUSP London Data Dive 2021** with Transport for London, Reed Mobility, WSP, GINGER, RunFriendly and Chordant

Each team has a directory in which to upload their code and video presentation.

Please take care only to upload code and not data. If you are using Jupyter Notebooks or similar, remember to check that comments do not accidentally include data fragments.

Please upload all your code by the end of the event and ask organisers if you need help with this.
